I couldn't find something that satisfied all of my requirements, so I created one.\r\n\r\n# Todo:\r\n\r\n- Support non-Debian based Linux systems\r\n- Shoot me an [email](mailto:sameet.sapra@gmail.com), or better yet, post an issue, if you'd like to see more added or if there's a bug on your environment!",
