# Development Environment Setup

This script helps people set up their Terminal for development.

Installs:
- git
- Homebrew (Mac only)
- Heroku Toolbelt
- pip/Django
- rbenv/rvm/Rails
- Postgres
- MySQL

# Why

I created this project because I looked for really simple scripts that installed a lot of common developer tools all at once, for all operating systems. I couldn't find something that satisfied all of my requirements, so I created one.

Shoot me an [email](mailto:sameet.sapra@gmail.com), or better yet, file an issue if you'd like to see more added or if there's a bug on your environemnt!

# Todo:

- Support non-Debian based Linux systems
